    <h1>Terms Of Service and Rules</h1>
    <h3>General Rules</h3>
    <p>These apply to all servers hosted under globalcraft. The main rules are, no grefing, no bulling, and no cheating. Anyone who violates thses rules will be banned. If you are banned due to your actions, you will not be able to use that serer for 30min, next time will be a permanant ip ban, so no switching accounts. If you are reported as the same person on a different account, then an admin will investigate and we will ban you from all servers. If you think you were banned for no reason, you can go to the discord server and under the trail channel, you can state the details of the ban and we will determine if you are to be unbanned or not.</p>

    <h3>Bedrock Server</h3>
    <p>These rules apply to the minecraft bedrock server. If you want a map change then contact an admin and if you get 16 or more votes it will change. If you want a private server for a given amount of time through globalcraft, go to discord and request one. Once the server is created and running, join the main globalcraft server and you and the people you specify will be transfered to the personal server. If you want mods or plugins for that server specify them and they will be added, note that this will increase the times needed to get the server running. (Pricing may vary and there can only be up to 16 people in the private server)</p>

        <h3>Java Server</h3>
<p>These rules apply to the minecraft java server. Unlike the bedrock server there will be no server hosting, the reason for this is performance related. If you want more details, go to discord. With java there will be a lot more plugins such as ranks for players, this will allow for more freedom in what you do and less hastle thean the bedrock server when trying to do certain things. To make up for no private server hosting, the java server will allow votes on what plugins will be avalible for everyone in the server to use. To do this use the vote feature in game.</p>

<br>

<h3>Mindustry Server</h3>
<p>These rules apply to the mindustry server. The mindistry server will mostly be controlled by discord for things such as new maps, but there will be no private hosting and no plugin votes. They will be controlled by the owner only. To avoid griefers, you will have to apply for permissions in discord in the mindustry channel. We will see if you are experienced enough to play. (You just need to know some basics) Once that is over, join the PvE or PvP server and an admin will give you permissions. And if voted out you willnot be able to play foor 30min, after 3 of these it is a perms ban.</p>
